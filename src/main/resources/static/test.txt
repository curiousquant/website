The Righteous Shall Live By Faith
Romans 1:16-17
16For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 17For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”

Faith, what is it? It is like sitting on a chair missing one of its legs and believing you won’t fall. Hebrews 11:1 says,
11Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
All the other religions of the world talk about works, about what you do to earn salvation. But in Christianity, its about a relationship with Christ. Jesus, the lover of your soul, laid down His own life for you so that you would not go to hell but experience God’s love poured out in your life through His grace. In John 15:13 it says,
13Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.
So how do enter into a relationship with Christ? By accepting Him as your Lord and savior. This is how you come to faith in Jesus Christ. 
In Isaiah 53:6 it says,
6All we like sheep have gone astray; 
   we have turned-every one-to his own way; 
and the LORD has laid on him 
   the iniquity of us all.
In Romans 6:23 it says,
23For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
All of our sins, all our wrong doings, can be covered by believing in Jesus. The blood of Jesus who hung on the cross for 6 hours and was flogged by Roman whips that had metal on the edge of the leather, His blood covers you if only you would believe. The significance of blood covering you goes back to the Passover in Egypt. Moses warned that the first born would die if pharaoh did not let his people go free from slavery. In the 10th plague: death of the first born, the destroyer would not kill the first born of the homes that had lamb’s blood covered on the doorpost. Exodus 12:21-32. So we see Jesus’s blood covers over our sins if we would only believe in Him and what He has done for us. All of us have sinned and by nature are sinners because of Adam and Eve. In Romans 5:12 it says,
12Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned.
But Jesus came to save us by being the atoning sacrifice for our sins. He took on the blame, He took on our shame, He took your place in hell, while He did no wrong to deserve it. Can you understand this? God chose to give His only Son to take our sins for us and die on the cross for us so that we may live with Him for eternity. Where we will be in complete joy with no more tears, no more sorrow, no more pain, no more sickness, no more sin and no more shame. Jesus loves you more than you can understand. He took on the sins of billions of people and bore all their punishment and rose again on the third day and ascended into heaven and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty who shall come to judge the quick and the dead. 
God made us righteous not through our works, but by faith. “The righteous shall live by faith.” God imputed unto those who would believe in Him, His righteousness. In 2 Corinthians 5:21 it says,
	21For our sake he made him to become sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
In Philippians 3:9 it says,
	9and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness for God that depends on faith.
God loves you. I encourage you to have faith and believe in the saving power of Christ. John 3:16 says, 
16”For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.”
